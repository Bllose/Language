People are asking me Why do you need a pre-farm? and Why don't you have pools working already? The answers are Because it's been less than a month before we suddenly needed them ASAP and to pay for the engineers who are building it.  

I'd like to emphasize that we aren't selling any tokens, have raised money under normal investment terms, and chia is not a security. My point is that some community members are being obnoxiously entitled and should knock it off.

For some odd reason the 'Chia burns out hard drives!' is getting repeated as the fashionable fud. This is odd, because for the most part it's just plain wrong (thread)   
> **burn out**  
> (BREAK)  
> If something such as a motor burns out, it stops working because of damage from heat.  
> **FUD**  
> FUD is a disinformation strategy used by marketing and sales professionals that stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. It's commonly used in the sales, marketing, polling, and public ralations fields.  
> FUD is used to influence consumer perception of a competitor's product by appealing to fear.  
> Professionals using the FUD strategy in campaigns will share negative and false information about a competitor, their service, or their products. They will spread questionable information about competition with the hopes that consumers will find their product more appealing. This strategy is commonly used in scenarios when a company's product is inferior to competition.

If you plot with a plain old HD or an enterprise-class SSD then your drive will survive no problem. Plotting on hard drives, including the one which you'll probably leave your plot on, works fine. It's a bit slower and requires more head room, but works fine.  

We've gone to great pains and put a lot of technical wizardry into getting plotting even on HDs to work completely acceptably. The amount of head room it needs isn't much more than one plot, and the time it takes isn't much more than double.

The benefit of this is that it's a completely general system built on layer 2. Sorry for the need to replot, we got transactions out as soon as we could and that was higher priority than pooling protocol, which we're now getting out as quickly as possible.

The supported standard pool protocol will support(1) pools being able to allow any rando to join/leave at any time without having to worry about people scamming then and (2) pool users being able to switch at any time with worst case the pool stiffed you what they owed you.

There will never be an official pool but I may link to ones which are credible/low fee/well run/not scammy.

How long it will take for there to be high quality pools once our prototype is out I don't know. Plotting to pool protocol will work then and switching is easy though.
> **prototype**  
> the first example of something, such as a machine or other industrial product, from which all later forms are developed.

This is a bit of a bump out of the plot to pool and a pulling in of the release of a full prototype because the work was more front loaded than I thought at first.

Launch estimate update for chia pooling protocol: Currently the 17th of this month for both plot to pool and a pool prototype being out.
