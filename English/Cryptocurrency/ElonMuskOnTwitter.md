Unexpectedly there was an opportunity for a brief informal catchup between _@elonmusk_ and myself at _#gigafactory_ this afternoon. A brief wrap up of the progress in an excellent mood. Not having been on site for months I was amazed by the current status. Safe ongoing journey, Elon.  

_@elonmusk_ reply to _@joergstb_  
Great progress so far! Thank you for the support from Brandenburg. I would also like to express appreciation for the permit authorities, as I know this is a large and complex project.  
When all the finishing touches are done, I hope it will be considered a jewel of Brandenburg!

To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can't drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal

Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.  

Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.  

Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy. We are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use <1% of Bitcoin's energy/transaction.
