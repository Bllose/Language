# NOUN GRAMMAR  
**A group of words, consisting of a subject and a finite form of a verb**  
PS:  
In the sentence "I can't cook very well but I make quite good pancakes" both "I can't cook very well" and "I make good pancakes" are **main/independent** clauses(= they are of equal importance and could each exist as a separate sentence).  
In the sentence "I'll get you some stamps if I go to town", "if I go to town" is a **subordinate/dependent"** clause(= it is not as important as the main part of the sentence and could not exist as a separate sentence).
