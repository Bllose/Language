Next month, the TIOBE programming language of the year will be announced.
This award is given to the programming language that has had the highest increase in ratings in 2021.
At the moment, C# is by far the most likely candidate for this title. It is interesting to note that C# has never won the "TIOBE index programming language of the year award"
during its 21 years of existence, although it has been in the top 10 for the last 2 decades.
Let's see what happens next month!
Other interesting moves in the TIOBE index this month are Swift (from #14 to #10), R (from #15 to #11), and Kotlin(from #33 to #26).
